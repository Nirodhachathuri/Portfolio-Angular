                  My interest lies in the field of data science, which comprises a wide range of categories and topics.
                  Currently, my primary focus is on data, which can be classified into three main categories:
                  structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Among these categories, I have chosen to
                  concentrate on unstructured data for my final MSc research. This research topic has piqued my interest
                  the most, and I have learned a great deal in this area. <br> Within unstructured data, there are
                  various types, including text, images, voice, and more. From this diverse range of data, I chose to
                  focus on text data for my project. LinkedIn is the best platform for staying updated on the latest
                  technologies, making it an ideal source for staying informed about recent developments and the most
                  current technologies. Through this platform, I've accessed numerous resources related to my chosen
                  topic, further enhancing my knowledge and experience.<br>Currently, social media is the most popular
                  platform compared to others. It allows us to showcase anything to our audience or customers at any
                  time and in any way we choose. On this platform, customer preferences and their feedback are
                  invaluable, as these comments and feedback can help determine the popularity of an item.<br>

              For my research, I chose the YouTube platform to assess the popularity of items. YouTube hosts a wide
                  range of content, primarily entertainment videos. From this category, I decided to focus on music
                  videos. The music category on YouTube encompasses a vast array of music videos, and with my experience
                  and knowledge, I selected Sri Lankan music videos as the focus of my project.<br>
                  This represents the background of my research topic selection. I must say that this topic is of
                  personal interest and particularly exciting to me.

                  A science words dictionary is developed here to search words with meanings in subjects such as
                  Physics, Chemistry, Botany, and Zoology, separately. This application is developed with the
                  Java Programming Language and My SQL database server. Main features are to choose the word
                  category, type the word in text area and to give the English word with its Sinhala meaning. For
                  some words, it gives Sinhala meaning and a short description of the word as well.

                  In my life journey, I have encountered various challenges. As a student, after completing my
                  undergraduate degree, I embarked on my career path. I am fortunate to say that my first job, or what
                  can
                  be called an internship, was at Nestle Lanka PLC. I am honored to describe it as a stroke of luck.
                  During this period, I worked in the Industrial Performance Section as an intern. During my first job
                  experience, I encountered new concepts and theories related to the industry, including various
                  performance measurement theories. Additionally, I was responsible for machine inspections to assess
                  their efficiency against expected values. This entire experience was profoundly enriching and has left
                  a
                  lasting impact on my life.
