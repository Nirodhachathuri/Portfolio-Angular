                  My interest lies in the field of data science, which comprises a wide range of categories and topics.
                  Currently, my primary focus is on data, which can be classified into three main categories:
                  structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Among these categories, I have chosen to
                  concentrate on unstructured data for my final MSc research. This research topic has piqued my interest
                  the most, and I have learned a great deal in this area. <br> Within unstructured data, there are
                  various types, including text, images, voice, and more. From this diverse range of data, I chose to
                  focus on text data for my project. LinkedIn is the best platform for staying updated on the latest
                  technologies, making it an ideal source for staying informed about recent developments and the most
                  current technologies. Through this platform, I've accessed numerous resources related to my chosen
                  topic, further enhancing my knowledge and experience.<br>Currently, social media is the most popular
                  platform compared to others. It allows us to showcase anything to our audience or customers at any
                  time and in any way we choose. On this platform, customer preferences and their feedback are
                  invaluable, as these comments and feedback can help determine the popularity of an item.<br>

              For my research, I chose the YouTube platform to assess the popularity of items. YouTube hosts a wide
                  range of content, primarily entertainment videos. From this category, I decided to focus on music
                  videos. The music category on YouTube encompasses a vast array of music videos, and with my experience
                  and knowledge, I selected Sri Lankan music videos as the focus of my project.<br>
                  This represents the background of my research topic selection. I must say that this topic is of
                  personal interest and particularly exciting to me.
